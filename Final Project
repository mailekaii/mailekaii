A few takeaways we have from this project involve trying to motivate and inform others into living in a safe and healthy community. Through our website, you can see in each tab how COVID has took a big toll on many peoples lives living in the United States. 
 In the first tab you can see the graph with the total amount of deaths in the U.S. and the affect it had. From our second tab you can notice that we have data about the total infections. With the amount of total infections we notice how easily the disease can be spread and pre-cautions you should take so you do not catch COVID. 
 Lastly, in our third tab we show data about hospitalization inclduing patients who were inside the ICU. Overall, the key takeaway is that our website is informative about COVID-19, providing data and analysis that is useful. 
 Not only do you gain valuable information about how easy it is to catch covid, but you also gain the knowledge of how it has affected lives from hospitalization and death. Another takeaway we get out of this website is our self-diagnose questions, based off of research about having symptoms of being sick. We have provided a 
 self-questionaire to determine if you actually have COVID or if you are experiencing signs of a cold. The last takeaway from our website is that the user should feel motivated to take precautionary measures for COVID, as it is still ever-present in our society, which is shown in this website.
